				The six main protagonists frequently visited Central Perk throughout the series. It is situated in New York
				City's Greenwich Village, in the same apartment block as Monica's apartment. It was where they spent much of
				their free time conversing. There are 97 steps away from Chandler and Joey's apartment as Joey counts in "The
				One With George Stephanopoulos". In every episode, the gang somehow always ends up getting the same set of
				chairs, and the couch. In many episodes fans have noticed a "Reserved" sign on the main table of the area. This
				is also sometimes on the side table (on the left of screen).

			</div>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Rachel works as a waitress at Central Perk from autumn 1994 until winter 1996/1997. Being
				pretty much a spoiled, self-centered individual throughout this period of her life, Rachel clearly shows
				ineptitude at work, mixing up orders, neglecting her waiting duties, and showing little care about where
				everything goes and how it should be done. Ironically, in "The One With The Flashback", it is revealed that
				prior to getting this job, while out with her friends one night, she had responded to a waiter getting their
				drinks mixed up by remarking: "how hard is it to get a couple of drinks?". When Joey starts working at Central
				Perk, Rachel mentions that she would sneeze on the food of any customers who were rude to her. She also told
				Ross this when they had dinner with her father in "The One With The Race Car Bed" when she revealed she served
				"sneezers" to rude customers.
			</p>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
				It quickly becomes clear that Rachel does not care for her job at Central Perk, only for her financial income.
				However, she does try for other job opportunities in fashion (mostly during Season 1), with little success. In
				Season 3, she decides to pursue the fashion business again after Gunther assigns her to re-training, quitting
				her waiting job to work with Fortunata Fashions, then moving on to Bloomingdale's.</p>

			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Joey becomes a waiter at the coffee shop half-way through Season 6. His acting career being
				at a standstill, Joey is tight on money, so much that he can't afford paying for coffee. Gunther decides to let
				him work there. Like Rachel, Joey shows ineptitude at the job. Unlike Rachel, however, this is mostly due to his
				immaturity coinciding with the house's policies. However, later in the season, Joey's acting career takes a step
				forward when he gets the lead role in Mac & C.H.E.E.S.E.. This makes him quit his waiting job, which he does
				without mentioning anything to Gunther. Gunther, however, points this out to him in "The One Where Paul's The
				Man", and that he was going to fire Joey anyway.</p>

			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Phoebe Buffay was also a regular fixture in Central Perk, and played songs such as Smelly
				Cat to often bemused audiences. Phoebe was, at one point, replaced by Stephanie Schiffer, a professional who was
				hired by Terry. Ross also performed his keyboard music from there twice in "The One With Phoebe's Uterus".
				Phoebe's former singing partner Leslie also performed there at least once.</p>

			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Throughout the coffee shop are small tables with chairs that extras on the show usually
				occupy. These, from the main camera angle, are behind the large orange sofa in the middle of the shop. The green
				chair on the right, the coffee table and the table and chair on the left are nearly always used as the main
				setting for any scenes in Central Perk. In the earlier episodes, irrespective of how busy the coffee shop
				became, those seats were always available. The writers turned this into a joke and, in the first episode of
				season three, the six main characters arrive in the shop to find their seats taken, apparently by Kevin Bright,
				Marta Kauffman and David Crane, the show's creators and the writers of Season Three. They then look at each
				other, dejected, and walk out. The artwork in the back of Central Perk was changed every three episodes
				(including images of King Kong and Uncle Sam), but the layout of the furniture remained largely unchanged for
				the entire series.</p>

			</div>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The most prominent fixture of Central Perk is the large orange couch that the characters
				usually sit on. It usually seats four of the Friends at one time. One of the others then occupies the green
				chair on the right and, if all six are present, there is a table with one chair to the left that sits the last
				person. Rarely is anyone else ever seen on the couch and the guys consider it their own. In one instance,
				Chandler is seen sitting reading, when a young man comes in and goes to sit down on the green chair, only for
				Chandler to promptly usher him away. Another example is when Rachel complains about sitting by the window
				instead of the couch, or when the Friends came in only to see the couch taken, and leave. In "The One With The
				Bullies" two bullies 'steal' the seating area, and also steal Chandler's hat. In "The One With The Ultimate
				Fighting Champion", Robin Williams and Billy Crystal come in the coffee house and ask the cast to move over.
				They are sitting there having a personal conversation, which the cast overhears.
			</p>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
				The couch is also seen in the opening credits of the show in front of the large fountain the cast of Friends
				dance in. At the end of the credits all of the friends sit on the couch at once as Monica turns off the lamp to
				the right</p>

			<h1>gunther</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Gunther is the manager of Central Perk, where the six main characters spent a great deal of
				their free time. He is portrayed by the late James Michael Tyler.</p>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Gunther has a smoking habit in common with Chandler.[1] Since season 3, he has had a
				consistent unrequited love for Rachel but only gets the courage to confess in the series finale, when he finds
				out that she is going to Paris. Gunther used to be an actor, having played a character called Bryce in All My
				Children. Being killed off by getting buried in an avalanche is how he ends up being a waiter at Central Perk.
				He confesses this to Joey in "The One Where Eddie Won't Go", after Joey confides in him that his character, Dr.
				Drake Ramoray, was thrown down a shaft in daytime show Days of our Lives.
			</p>
			<div class="image-grid">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
				Though Gunther is a permanent fixture in the everyday lives of the friends, he never penetrates the inner
				circle. This becomes a running joke. At Ross' bachelor party, Chandler announces Gunther as his best man, to
				which Gunther instantly replies: "What's my last name?". Chandler defeatedly answers "Central Perk?". Another
				example of this is when Ross is celebrating getting tenure. Ross asks Gunther for six glasses, to which Gunther
				asks hopefully "You want me to join you?". Ross replies "Oh, I thought Joey was here - five is good."
			</p>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
				Gunther is on good enough terms with the friends, however, to often be invited to their informal parties, such
				as Phoebe's birthday party, Rachel's birthday party, Emily's farewell party, Ross' bachelor party, Rachel's
				premature surprise birthday party and Chandler and Monica's Halloween party. He is, however, left out of the
				official formalities, like Ross' London wedding and Monica and Chandler's wedding, but he attends Phoebe's
				wedding.
			</p>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
				In a 2019 interview, James Michael Tyler said he thought Gunther would be the owner of Central Perk and a very
				small apartment in either the East or West Village, but is content with his life.[1]</p>
