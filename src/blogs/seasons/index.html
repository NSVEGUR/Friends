				This is my ranking of the 10 Seasons of Friends from least favorite to my ultimate favorite. Just putting it out
				there: I don’t dislike any season at all so the first one you’ll see in the list doesn’t mean I dislike it, it
				just means that I like the others more. I don’t even dislike any episodes let alone a whole season. It was so
				hard to pick an order, I must’ve switched this list around a million times. Also, remember this is my personal
				ranking. I am in no way saying that a certain season is better than another because I say so. This is just my
				opinion! Anyways, without further ado, here’s my list!

			<h1>10. Season 1</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Yes, the season that started it all is at the bottom of this list for me. I felt season one
				was more, dare I say… Boring than the others. It just has my least amount of favorite episodes in it. Obviously
				the show was just starting off so in every episode it’s still finding its footing. As the season went on the
				episodes got better. The Ross and Rachel, will they/won’t they storyline picked up and things became more
				interesting. For me, season one is obviously hilarious and has some iconic episodes but is not as great as the
				other nine.

			<h1>9. Season 6</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;I love the beginning of season 6 I must say. Everything about Ross trying to convince
				Rachel to stay married while Phoebe tries to convince him he has feeling for Rachel is too hilarious. Meanwhile
				Chandler and Monica move forward in their relationship by moving in together. I feel more towards the middle of
				the season it got a little more bland but picked up in the end.

			<h1>8. Season 8</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;This is hard for me because season eight use to be my ultimate favorite season. So, it’s
				pretty crazy they it went from number one to number eight for me. Ultimately, I realized I made it my number one
				because two of my favorite episodes are in it (TOW the Rumor and Rachel Has a Baby). Aside from Rachel and Ross
				having a baby this season isn’t too significant. Not too much is happening with the rest of the gang during this
				season. It still had a special place in my heart but when I think about the other seasons I can’t imagine
				placing the others below this one.

			<h1>7. Season 2</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;I struggled with which one to put higher, season three or season two. Obviously, season two
				lost the battle. This episode finally gives us what we were waiting for, ROSS AND RACHEL FINALLY GET TOGETHER!
				Episode after episode you knew it was going to happen but the big question was, WHEN?! Finally episode 14 gives
				us what we want. I love this season purely because of the Ross and Rachel aspect of it all. I think those two
				were the driving force of season two. Obviously, Monica and Richard helped as well. I loved Richard. I think
				Monica and him were a nice couple but just not meant for each other. This season didn’t torture us with a
				cliffhanger either which is pretty bittersweet.

			<h1>6. Season 4</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;This season introduces us to the horror that is Emily. Uggghhhhh. No, I am not punishing
				the whole season for Emily though. The Rachel and Joshua story line wasn’t too interesting because, I can’t
				speak for anyone else but… I didn’t really care if they ended up dating or not. I did like when she got all
				crazy on him though when she got jealous of Emily and Ross. The Joey/Chandler/Kathy story line was very
				interesting on the other hand. Obviously this season holds one of the most, maybe THE most iconic episode of
				Friends, The One With the Embryos aka: The guys vs girls episode. This season does have the best cliffhanger out
				of all the cliffhangers in the show. “I, Ross.” “I, Ross.” “Take thee, Emily.” “Take thee, Rachel.” I can’t
				imagine how the fans who watched back then made it through those months of hiatus.

			<h1>5. Season 3</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;This is a really, really funny season. This one also has one of the most iconic episodes,
				The One Where Everybody Gets Ready. Ross and Rachel break up which is a huge moment in the show. Actually, one
				of the biggest moments in the show. We all cried, it’s okay to admit it. Then the rest of the season is left
				wondering, are they getting back together?! Are they not?! And just to kill you even more the writers have them
				kiss and leave you with a cliffhanger. Gotta love those writer, huh? The Monica and Pete story line was fine but
				I found it interesting when they had him try and become the ultimate fighting champion. That was some funny
				stuff.

			<h1>4. Season 9</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The reason this season isn’t number higher is because of (and I’m sorry to all those who
				love them together but….) Joey and Rachel. Please don’t hate me Joey/Rachel shippers! I have loved every single
				thing about this show… Joey and Rachel getting together is the one and only thing I dislike about the show. Even
				the cast hated it! Okay, I’ll stop with my Joey and Rachel hate. Again, sorry to the shippers. Besides that,
				this season is HI-LAR-I-OUS! Obviously if you read my Top 10 Friends episodes you know my favorite episode is in
				the season. If you haven’t read my Top Ten Friends episodes, you can check it out here:
				https://friendstvsite.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/top-10-friends-episodes/. This season just had SO many hilarious
				episodes, I love it. We also meet Amy for the first time and her first appearance episode is way too funny. I
				can’t wait to review that one (I got a long ways to go). Honestly, I can’t say anything more than this season is
				just hilarious. Yes, it ends with a cliffhanger… A cliffhanger I’m not very fond of but it still makes you want
				to find out what’s going to happen next.

			<h1>3. Season 5</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;I feel like this is everyone’s favorite season so you all may hate me for not ranking it
				#1. Ultimately, this is my personal ranking but if I was doing a more critical ranking, this would be #1. This
				season is very interesting. Monica and Chandler are sneaking around, Emily tells Ross he can no longer see
				Rachel, meanwhile Rachel is still in love with Ross. Nobody knows about Monica and Chandler but slowly but
				surely a few start to find out until The One Where Everybody Find Out happens (another iconic episode). The show
				ends with the second best cliffhanger, Monica and Chandler are about to get married which is crazy in itself but
				just when you think these writers can’t get any better, they do. Just as Monica and Chandler try to go in, Ross
				and Rachel walk out. Pure genius. Wraps up an amazing season with an incredible cliffhanger.

			<h1>2. Season 10</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;You know a show is good when you can rank the last season so high. Season 10 is so
				impressive because if you love sitcoms like I do, most have a recurring theme of just turning to crap in the
				last season. Season 10 is so good I wouldn’t even believe it’s the last. I swear these writers could’ve gone on
				for years. They never ran out of story lines and were just pure creative geniuses all 10 years. The finale is
				perfect and honestly, everything I could’ve asked for. I’m feeling so nostalgic. I love you, season 10.

			<h1>1. Season 7</h1>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Season seven use to be my least favorite season and now look where it is! Is it too cheesy
				to put a started from the bottom now we’re here, joke? I think I just did. Anyways, it’s the last season of
				Friends I ever purchased and I use to not care too much about season 7. I was wrong. Season 7 is, in my opinion
				the funniest season. The One Where/With Monica’s Thunder, Phoebes Cookies, Nap Partners, Chandler Doesn’t like
				Dogs, Rosita Dies, etc, etc, etc. This season is pure comedy gold, I believe. Also, Mondler gets married! This
				season also has an incredible cliffhanger, we find out Rachel is pregnant, what will happen next? Ahhhh! Season
				7, you stole my heart.
