          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;I love watching sitcoms but the one that I love the most is F.R.I.E.N.D.S. The
            friendship and the bond
            between each of them is what I crave for. Though it is not possible to have such great friends just imagine
            how amazing it would be if it were real. Also the fact that I can relate to each character in one or the
            other way is good. I think I am funny like Chandler, a lil bit foodie like Joey, I do have OCD like Monica,
            crazy like Phoebe, a geek like Ross and beautiful like Rachel ( I wish :p ). Each character has its own
            essence that the show has brought out. Mondler is an emotion, Ross and Rachel ohh get together already!! The
            way each of them support each other and make fun at the same time is incredible. I always crack up while
            watching, always. The BEST !!</p>

          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;There surely can be no doubt that Friends will go down in history as one of the best
            sitcoms ever. Sure it
            perhaps went on a little too long and the series gradually became more and more like a soap opera but it is
            important to remember why this show was such a hit and why people watch it again and again and laugh equally
            hard each time.
            From the on and off again Ross and Rachel relationship to the buddy love of Joey and Chandler the stories
            flow effortlessly from episode one until episode two hundred and thirty six. The cast are on top form
            through thick and thin and regardless of what they have done since or will do in the future they will always
            be remembered for Friends.</p>

          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Hilarious - one of the greatest comedy series of all time.

            The lives of six twenty- (later, thirty-) something friends living in Manhattan. Their relationships, work,
            troubles and triumphs, all told with biting wit.

            Very funny and, as someone who was in my twenties when the show started, incredibly relatable. Sure, it does
            present a stylized and almost idealistic picture of being a young, single adult, but that's part of its
            charm.

            Casting is largely spot-on and launched the careers of all six of its stars. Some of the guest stars were
            pretty incredible too...</p>

          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;This was one interesting show, essentially it defined comedy for the millenial
            generation.
            .The writing is absolutely
            incredible. Producers Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin Bright had an amazing writing crew which brought
            all the jokes and conversations to life. The producers and writers wrote a plot line which made the audience
            and fans more hooked in the show. Although the show mostly revolves around
            relationships, it isn't just about love. It's really about the friendship and the bond that the main
            characters have with each other, inspiring us all. It's not
            just any show. It is a
            very compelling, hilarious, touching and exceptional sitcom. This show brings various vital life lessons and
            a meaningful lesson about friendship. The ending is flawless. All six characters are happy and have moved on
            with their lives. The acting, casting, costumes, sets and music were all exceptional.</p>
